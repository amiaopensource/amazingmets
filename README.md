This is a sample METS instance documenting a media item reformatted for purposes of preservation. It draws on existing schema to specifically capture information about the physical source item (in this case, a U-matic analog video tape), preparation actions, the digitization event, the process history (including the capture of a preservation master file and a mezzanine file), file checksum values, and other technical metadata.
